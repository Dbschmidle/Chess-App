# Description 
This is a personal python project for learning purposes. 

The goal is to be able to play chess in the terminal against a chess-bot (see pictures below). Functionality for this game should be to:
1. Save games locally to disk / boot saved games during runtime.
2. Use an SQL database to recognize user details.
3. Change chessbot difficulty.  

# How to Run
1. Install the latest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
2. Run main.py OR download the executable (TBD)  


**What it should look like**
